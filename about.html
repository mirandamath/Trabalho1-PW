    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm Matheus Miranda, a 22-year-old student currently in my 5th semester of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Senac São Paulo, Santo Amaro campus. My curiosity has always gravitated towards technology and programming. I've extensively worked with C/C++, Python, Java, and C#, engaging in both back-end and front-end projects.</p>

    <p>At present, I'm immersing myself in the field of data storage, particularly DNA data storage. I often find my inspiration in literature, continually seeking to uncover more about this field and its endless possibilities. I believe DNA data storage holds immense promise and has the potential to revolutionize how we store information and data in the future.</p>
